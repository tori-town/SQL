# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#creating the table

CREATE TABLE Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM Spotifydata LIMIT 10;

#First I determined the most popular song for each artist.

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity 
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity;

# Then I determined the top 10 most dancible songs, and their artists.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Then I determined which songs have the highest energy and are the most popular.

SELECT artist_name, track_name, energy, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY energy DESC, popularity DESC
LIMIT 25;

# Then I determinded the artist with the longest song.

SELECT artist_name, Max(duration_ms) FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY Max(duration_ms) DESC
LIMIT 1;

#Then I determined the average danceability by artist and track. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY avg(danceability) DESC;

#Then I determined the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT track_name, popularity, avg(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Then I calculated the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 

WITH popularity_average_temp AS (
SELECT s.artist_name, avg(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
Group BY artist_name
)

#using the average popularity for artists calculated abovce, I pulled every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above and labeled them as a “Top Star”.

SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
