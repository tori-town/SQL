## For this project, I queried sample reports from the City of Chicago including crime reports, public school safety reports, and the Chicago census.
## This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Science Certificate

#First, I determined the total number of recorded crimes in the report

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CHICAGOCRIMEDATA;

#Then I found all community areas with recorded crimes involving am minor

SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, DESCRIPTION FROM CHICAGOCRIMEDATA
WHERE DESCRIPTION LIKE '%MINOR%'
AND COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER IS NOT NULL;

#Then, I located all community areas with a per-capita-income lower than 11000

SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, PER_CAPITA_INCOME FROM CHICAGOCENSUS
WHERE PER_CAPITA_INCOME < 11000;

#Next, I found all case numbers involving a minor

SELECT CASE_NUMBER FROM CHICAGOCRIMEDATA
WHERE DESCRIPTION LIKE '%MINOR%';

#Then I determined which recorded crimes inovled a kidnapping of a child

SELECT * FROM CHICAGOCRIMEDATA
WHERE PRIMARY_TYPE = 'KIDNAPPING' AND DESCRIPTION LIKE '%CHILD%';

#Then I looked at all types of crimes recorded as happening at a school

SELECT DISTINCT PRIMARY_TYPE FROM CHICAGOCRIMEDATA
WHERE LOCATION_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%SCHOOL%';

#I then determined the average safety rating of each type of school

SELECT AVG(SAFETY_SCORE), ELEMENTARY_MIDDLE_OR_HIGH_SCHOOL FROM CHICAGOPUBLICSCHOOLS
GROUP BY ELEMENTARY_MIDDLE_OR_HIGH_SCHOOL;

#Next I looked at the 5 community areas with the highest percent of households below the poverty line

SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, PERCENT_HOUSEHOLDS_BELOW_POVERTY 
FROM CHICAGOCENSUS
ORDER BY PERCENT_HOUSEHOLDS_BELOW_POVERTY DESC
LIMIT 5;

#Then I found the community area with the highest number of recorded crimes

SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, COUNT(ID) FROM CHICAGOCRIMEDATA
GROUP BY COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
ORDER BY COUNT(ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;

#Next I determined the community area with the highest hardship index

SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME
FROM CHICAGOCENSUS WHERE COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME IN 
(SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME FROM CHICAGOCENSUS
WHERE COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME != 'CHICAGO' 
ORDER BY HARDSHIP_INDEX DESC
LIMIT 1);

#After determining the commuity area with the highest number of recorded crimes
#I used a subquery to determine the name of that commuity area

SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, COUNT(ID) AS "C_ID" FROM CHICAGOCRIMEDATA
GROUP BY COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
ORDER BY C_ID DESC;

SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME FROM CHICAGOCENSUS WHERE COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER IN
(SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER FROM CHICAGOCRIMEDATA WHERE COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER=25);

#Next I listed the case number, type of crime and community area for all crimes in community area number 18

SELECT CASE_NUMBER, PRIMARY_TYPE, COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
FROM CHICAGOCRIMEDATA 
WHERE COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER = 18;

#Next I listed all crimes that took place at a school. Include case number, crime type and community name

SELECT CASE_NUMBER, PRIMARY_TYPE, COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
FROM CHICAGOCRIMEDATA 
WHERE LOCATION_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%SCHOOL%';

#Then, for the communities of Oakland, Armour Square, Edgewater and CHICAGO I listed the associated community_area_numbers and the case_numbers.
SELECT ccd.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, ccd.CASE_NUMBER FROM CHICAGOCRIMEDATA CCD
FULL OUTER JOIN CHICAGOCENSUS CC ON CCD.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER = CC.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
WHERE COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME = 'Oakland'
OR COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME = 'Armor Square'
OR COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME = 'Edgewater'
OR COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME = 'CHICAGO';
